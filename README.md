Cooperative Capital Communities Alliance (C3 Alliance)
Description
Welcome to the Cooperative Capital Communities Alliance (C3 Alliance), a project managed by Plausible Potentials Consulting (PPC). We are a consulting agency focused on delivering innovative solutions to cooperatives and community development trust organizations. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Blockchain, AI, and NLP, we aim to empower communities and cooperatives with state-of-the-art software applications.

In this repository, we focus on using Hyperledger Projects: Fabric, Indy, Aries, and Firefly, along with Google services like Firebase and Cloud. Our development is primarily in GoLang and Python.

Installation
To get started with the C3 Alliance project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Hyperledger Fabric, Indy, Aries, and Firefly
Google services (Firebase, Google Cloud, etc.)
GoLang and Python environments set up
Detailed installation instructions will be provided in the respective directories of this repository.

Usage
Our case study project revolves around a global association of cooperatives. Each cooperative is a Community Development Trust (CDT), operating as an autonomous sovereign entity. These CDTs perform various roles, such as Organization, Node, and Peer within a private, permissioned blockchain.

Community members also serve as Peers within the different channels on the blockchain.
